physicalHardDriveInfo
name;size;physicalVolumeName //first put the name and then set the actual physical volume object by finding it later when retrieving data

//maybe I need to create more instance variables for the names b/c I need to set the names first and create all the objects
//before I set the actual physical volume object to physicalHardDrive for example
physicalVolumeInfo
name;uuid;physicalHardriveName;volumeGroupName

volumeGroupInfo
name;uuid

logicalVolumeInfo
name;uuid;size;volumeGroupName

Saving data
1) Add a dataInfo method for each class that returns a String with all of its instance variable info in the format above
2) Add the number of physical hardDrives to the savedData file
3) Add each physical hardDrive data to the savedData file
4) add the number of physical volumes to the savedData file
5) Add each physical volume data to the savedData file
6) Add the number of volume groups to the savedData file
7) Add each physical volume group to the savedData file
8) Add the number of logical volumes to the savedData file
9) Add each logical volume data to the savedData file

Retrieving data
- read from file and put in 4 arrayList the Strings of the info for each object
1) Set all physical hardDrives with name only and add each to the physicalHardDriveArrayList in the volumeManager
2) Set all physical volumes with name only and add each to the physicalVolumeArrayList in the volumeManager
3) Set all volume group with name only and add each to the VolumeGroupArrayList in the volumeManager
4) Set all logical volumes with name only
5) Find and set the physical volume object to the physical hardDrives
6) Find and set the physical hardDrive object and the volumeGroup object to physicalVolume
7) Find and set the volumeGroup object to logicalVolume
8) FInd and add all physicalVolumes associated with each volumeGroup to the arraylist
9) FInd and add all logicalVolumes associated with each volumeGroup to the arraylist
